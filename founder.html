                <p>The Holy Fatima Group of Schools was founded in 1977 by a visionary leader committed to transforming education in Hyderabad. Our founder believed in the power of education to change lives and create opportunities for young minds.</p>
                
                <p><b>Dr. M.A. Ahmed</b> was a visionary educationist and a pioneer in fostering academic excellence. He made a bold decision to resign from his job in the Railways to pursue higher education, earning his B.Ed. and embarking on a lifelong journey in teaching. His commitment to education began at an early age with the establishment of <b>M.A. Ahmed Institute of Maths & Science in 1962</b>, which later evolved into Holy Fatima High School.</p>

                <p>Recognizing the transformative power of education, Dr. Ahmed laid the foundation for <b>The Holy Fatima Group of Schools in 1977</b> with the mission of shaping young minds and creating new opportunities for students in Hyderabad. His dedication to providing quality education led to the expansion of institutions that nurtured academic excellence and personal growth.</p>

                <p>Beyond school education, Dr. Ahmed played a pivotal role in shaping higher education in the region.<b> He was the founder of several esteemed institutions, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Deccan College of Medical Sciences</li>
                    <li>Deccan College of Engineering and Technology (under the aegis of Darus Salam Educational Trust)</li>
                    <li>Sultan-ul-Uloom Educational Society, which runs Muffakham Jah College of Engineering, Ghulam Ahmed College of Education, and other reputed institutions.</li>
 </b>               
</ul>
                </p>

                <p>His relentless efforts led to the establishment of numerous professional colleges across combined Andhra Pradesh, many of which continue to produce distinguished professionals.</p>

                <p><b>Dr. Ahmed was also deeply involved in academia and educational governance. He served as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Member of the Board of Management, Osmania University</li>
                    <li>Hon. Director of Dairatul Maarif'l Osmania</li>
                    <li>General Secretary of All India Muslim Educational Society (AIMES), A.P. Unit</li>
</b>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p>A lifelong learner, he pursued an <b>LL.M. in International Law in his early 60s</b> and had the distinct honor of being <b>the first Muslim to receive a Ph.D. in Education from Osmania University.</b> His dedication to education and community development was so profound that he declined an opportunity to serve as an advisor to the <b>Ethiopian government</b>, choosing <b>instead to devote his life to empowering the people of India through education.</b></p>

                <p>Through his leadership, countless students have gone on to achieve remarkable success in India and abroad. His legacy continues to inspire generations of educators and learners alike, ensuring that education remains a beacon of hope and progress.</p>
                
                <p>The vision continues to guide our institutions, ensuring that every student receives not just academic education, but a comprehensive approach to personal and intellectual growth.</p>
